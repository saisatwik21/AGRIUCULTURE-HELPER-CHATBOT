# AGRIUCULTURE-HELPER-CHATBOT
As India has an agro-based economy, 58% of its population relies on agricultureas its
primarymethod oflivelihood. In spite ofthis, the economic survey for 2019-2020indicates that 
agriculture growth in India has stagnated around 2.9% annually for the past 6 years. 
Considering the number of people in India still relying on it, it is a real concern. One of the 
prevailing issues is lack of right information. This problem can besolved by providing farmers
with expert advice and relevant information (e.g. determine when to irrigate, how to sow 
seeds, and which pesticides to use effectively to increase the yields). In this paper, the 
proposed chatbot called AgroBot is a multi- user chat application. AgroBot can overcome this 
problem by allowing farmers to obtain the information they need to succeed in an everchanging market and to enlargewith new technology and market demand in an easy-to use 
manner. In this project we are designing Chatbot for farmers where Chatbot ask farmer to 
upload crop image andthen application will apply Deep Learning CNN algorithm to predict 
disease from thatcrop leaf and display possible remedies. After getting remedies user can ask 
question related to crop such as crop name and then Chatbot will display soil, rainfall and 
otherdetails
